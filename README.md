Hi, my name is Rahul Vital, and I started my journey into coding 
very recently, after completing a MSc in Cancer Research. I am 
looking to eventually put the skills I learn while coding to help 
develop a project that incorporates both coding and cancer.

I've gained many valuable skills during my time researching,
such as working with a variety of data types, working with several data
analysis softwares such as FlowJo, R, and Excel.

I have completed a 13 week JavaScript course at Northcoders, 
learning the basics of JS, developing a solo project web application and developing 
a mobile application in a group project.

Solo Project:
NC News - 
This project is a web application called "NC News", a website created to allow users 
to read articles, post and delete comments and vote on articles. 
It was created with a React front-end and a Node.js/express back-end with a PostgresSQL 
as a database.


Group Projects:
RecipeBox - 
This project is a mobile application called "RecipeBox", an app created to allow users 
to record and see recipes from various online sources, post and delete recipes, and 
collections and vote on different recipes. 
It was created with a React Native front-end 
and a firebase back-end and database.
